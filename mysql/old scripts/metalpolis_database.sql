Root Cause Analysis (RCA), encompassing laboratory examination and analysis, are usually carried out by DNV GL to help the industry address the issue fundamentally, so that appropriate measures can be implemented for a safe and sustainable operation. With modern materials and our metallurgical lab, we combine the global expertise of DNV GL to locally assist our customers in investigating the failure of materials, weld, component and/or structure. \n\nServices related to laboratory failure analysis and root cause analyses (RCA): \nOn-site inspection, condition assessment, data and sample collection\nIn-situ metallurgical tests, examination and defect sizing\nLaboratory mechanical test, metallurgical evaluation and chemical analysis\nDetail fractographic examination and study by optical microscopy and SEM/EDX techniques\nRCA workshop facilitation with involvement of project team and DNV GL?s subject matter experts to systematically address possible contributing factors from design, fabrication/installation to operation to enable determination of immediate and root causes\nMaterial selection and corrosion assessment\nRecommending mitigation and prevention measures\nWeldability assessment and testing, welding procedure development\nPipeline and structural repair solutions and detailed terms of reference\nDetailed 3D Non-linear Finite Element Analyses to determine environmental or thermal stresses\nForensic analyses and expert witness for arbitration and litigation court cases.\nThe unique set and broad range of capabilities of our Singapore lab enable us to serve not only the oil and gas industry but also maritime, energy, infrastructure and other general industry.  \n\nOther services we offer: \nWeighing structure and module in fabrication yard upon completion for safe loadout and transportation of heavy and costly asset\nConcrete sleeper and rail components testing and qualification\nProof load, pressure and torque test of component\nQualification test of bridge bearing\nCalibration of load and pressure equipment - load cell, hydraulic Jack and transducer\nOn-site calibration of test bed, loading equipment and test rig\nIn-situ stress and strain gauging and measurement \nNoise and vibration measurement on board vessel and offshore platform\nQualification of Additively Manufactured (AM) product and component.', '0.00', '0.00', 0, 0, b'0'),

(101, 'TSA', 'sg', '', '123456789a', '', 'hoka (English: /???o?k?/; IAST: A?oka; died 232 BCE)[5], or Ashoka the Great, was an Indian emperor of the Maurya Dynasty, who ruled almost all of the Indian subcontinent from c.?268 to 232 BCE.[6] He was the grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, Chandragupta Maurya, who had created one of the largest empires in ancient India and then, according to Jain sources, renounced it all to become a Jain monk.[7] One of India\'s greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta\'s empire, and reigned over a realm that stretched from present-day Afghanistan in the west to Bangladesh in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala. The empire\'s capital was Pataliputra (in Magadha, present-day Patna), with provincial capitals at Taxila and Ujjain.\r\n\r\nIn about 260 BCE, Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of Kalinga (modern Odisha).[8] He conquered Kalinga, which none of his ancestors had done.[9] Some scholars suggest he belonged to the Jain tradition, but it is generally accepted that he embraced Buddhism.[10] Legends state he converted after witnessing the mass deaths of the Kalinga War, which he himself had waged out of a desire for conquest. \"Ashoka reflected on the war in Kalinga, which reportedly had resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations, ending at around 200,000 deaths.\"[11] Ashoka converted to Buddhism about 263 BCE.[8] He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to Sri Lanka and Central Asia, and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of Gautama Buddha.[12]\r\n\r\nBeyond the Edicts of Ashoka, biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later, such as the 2nd-century CE Ashokavadana (\"Narrative of Ashoka\", a part of the Divyavadana), and in the Sri Lankan text Mahavamsa (\"Great Chronicle\"). The emblem of the modern Republic of India is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka. Ashoka\'s name \"A?oka\" means \"painless, without sorrow\" in Sanskrit (the a privativum and ?oka, \"pain, distress\"). In his edicts, he is referred to as Dev?n?mpriya (Pali Dev?na?piya or \"the Beloved of the Gods\"), and Priyadar?in (Pali Piyadas? or \"He who regards everyone with affection\"). His fondness for his name\'s connection to the Saraca asoca tree, or \"Ashoka tree\", is also referenced in the Ashokavadana. H.G. Wells wrote of Ashoka in his book The Outline of History: \"Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Ashoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star.', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, b'0');
