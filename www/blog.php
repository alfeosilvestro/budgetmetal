                    <b>Oxy-fuel Cutting</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Flame cutting is by far the oldest of all the methods. It is most efficient when used to cut mild steel. The machine is relatively cheap and accessible; it is also deemed the ‘simplest´ both in size of equipment and use. Oxy-flame cuts thick sheets of steel from about 1 inch and will not cut sizes less than ¼ inches. The cutting process is quite slow but can be sped up with the use of multiple flames which need not be interrupted as it can go on for as long as oxygen is available. Its drawbacks are that it is not flexible and cutting precise shapes is almost impossible because of the heat that causes some parts of the sheet to be rounded causing wastage of the material.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <b>Plasma Cutting</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This is used to cut metallics like stainless steel, mild steel and aluminum. Using this cutter ensures that production takes place at a faster rate than with the oxy-fuel, it can also cut thinner plates (1/4 to 1/5 inches), but when the plates are less than ¼ inches, the edges of the plate begins to suffer some warp due to the heat, this can be avoided if the process is carried out under water though. The equipment for this method of cutting is more expensive and cumbersome than the flame costing around $15,000 to $100,000 and because of the cost and size, the number of plasma cutters that can be used at once is limited to maybe only two.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    <b>Laser Cutting</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This cutting process is slower because instead of using preheat, it uses a highly focused flame beam. The speed of the process is limited to the rate of the reaction between oxygen and carbon. The machine is quite expensive, with new ones going for about $350,000 and fairly used for about $250,000. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The kerf width and the quality of the edges cut are very precise with limited serration or wastage. The machine also has accurate automation that can allow you to set everything up, start the process and go home for the night, returning to meet neat piles of cut material for you. Laser can be used to cut fiberglass, some plastic and even fabric.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Waterjet Cutting</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This is the most efficient method used in cutting. The waterjet can cut literally anything that can be fit between it jets. It cannot cut diamond however, as it is too hard, it also cannot cut tempered glass or laminated ceramics because tempered glass would shatter and water will get between the laminated layers of the ceramics. The waterjet however has the best precision and can cut intricate shapes with the kerf width as narrow as 0.035 and there is no wastage or warp. The equipment is expensive and can cost about $100,000 to $350,000. It has a wide thickness range but cutting is slower and because of tendency of water to diverge, the quality produced may not be as refine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Careful deliberation and consultation will ensure that you get the cutter that will be best for you.

                    In the manufacturing industry, different metal tools and parts are used for different purposes, from medical supplies to kitchen silverware and widely in the aerospace and building industries. When making a decision on the material to use for a metal fabrication, the following must be carefully considered:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The cost of the end product</li>
                        <li>The location and application of the product</li>
                        <li>Corrosion, rusting, and staining</li>
                        <li>Flexibility, weight and aesthetics</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>	
                    The two most common materials in consideration for metal fabrications are aluminum and steel. Each has its pros and cons all of which should be carefully weighed as you make your decision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Aluminum </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Aluminum is easily malleable therefore, it makes the best material for spinning and constructing products that have intricate shapes; it is less brittle than steel and is less likely to crack or rip apart during the spinning process. Because it is a strong lightweight material, aluminum is widely used in the aerospace industry. The biggest draw of aluminum is its resistance to rusting without coating and painting, even if it is to be exposed to abrasive conditions. Even though it is about 1/3 the density of steel, aluminum offers versatility in the fabrication process.  What hampers its use the most is the cost of production. The price of the constituent materials, iron and bauxite ore will affect the final cost of the product, but because aluminum has several recyclable characteristics, it becomes a more viable choice.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Steel</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The steel industry uses about 1.3 billion tons of steel every year, and it is the most common material used in architecture. There are different sub-groups of steel and a type is chosen depending on the nature of the work to be done. Steel is generally stronger and denser than aluminum and can withstand incredible amount of heat‘Mild steel’ as carbon steel is also known, is steel containing not more than 2% carbon and no other alloy. Mild steel is magnetic so it is very commonly used in making electrical materials. It is very dense and welding requires precautions to prevent cracking. Carbon steel is corrosive due to the presence of iron oxide and should be coated if the product is to be exposed to moisture and air. If the metal is to be bent or welded or if the exterior of the final product is not going to be seen, use carbon steel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Stainless steel is an alloy of chromium, nickel, molybdenum and very little carbon along with some other elements to improve the mechanical and chemical properties of steel.  The main advantage of stainless steel is that it is not susceptible to corrosion because chromium oxide which is nonreactive forms in place of iron oxide. It is more aesthetically pleasing than mild steel. It is harder to weld and it is more brittle than carbon steel, it is also more expensive. Kitchen, cleanroom and medical equipment is best made with stainless steel.
                    Based on your budget and project type, you can now go on to choose the material that would be most effective for you.
